<h1>Review 3 different GUI Git clients</h1>

<h2>The Command Line</h2>
<p>The Command Line(For OSX) provides users with a very easy to use interface. It has a good looking GUI and provides the user a good visual representation of what their commands are doing.</p>
<h2>Git Box</h2>
<p>Git Box is a powerful tool for working with Git as it provides users with the ability to simply click to do even the most complex of tasks.</p>
<h2>Fork</h2>
<p>As it says on their website Fork is both ‘fast and friendly’ for the user. It has a well organised GUI which allows the user to see the effect of everything they do to their repository. It also gives the user Github notifications which is a nice added feature</p>
