<h1>2 Advantages of Git DVCS over Dropbox</h1>

<h2>Version control</h2>
<p>
    Git allows for better version control than Dropbox. This is because with Git every you change you make can be seen. With Dropbox the process for rolling back to older version of a file is much more complicated. Every time you make a change with Git you can add a message detailing exactly what changes you have made to a project.
</p>

<h2>Collaboration</h2>
<p>
    Git provides better ability for collaboration with branching. If another person wants to work on the same project without having to worry about work getting overwritten or lost. With dropbox if a change is made to a file this change is then committed for all users
