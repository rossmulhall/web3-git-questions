<h1>Comparing CLI vs. GUI clients for working with Git</h1>
<h2>Ease of use</h2>
<p>
    CLI clients provide more functionality, whereas a GUI client provides the user with more ease of use. This means that a GUI client will appeal more to new user, in my opinion. If the user wants to get more functionality with how they use Git the could then move over to using nothing but CLI. All in all a CLI allows the user more control over what they are doing.
</p>
<h2>Speed</h2>
<p>
    A CLI also allows users to work much fast than a GUI as the user simply has to input a few commands as opposed to searching for the button they need etc.
